Naive Streaming Engine implemented as Chain of responsibility.<br>
Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.<br>
Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.<br>
For a less naive enginge better to implement with reactive streams.
